## HW3-Anna-Shaljyan-Marketing-Analytics | Survival Analysis (50 points)
 Instructor: Karen Hovhannisyan
 Student: Anna Shaljyan

### To do list 

#### Dataset contains columns:
- ID: Subscriber ID
- region: region code
- tenure: lifetime
- age: subscriber’s age
- marital: subscriber’s marital status
- address: number of years living in the same address
- income: Subscriber’s annual income (K)
- ed: education level
- retire: retired (Yes/No)
- gender: gender (Female/Male)
- voice: voice (Yes/No)
- internet: internet (Yes/No)
- forward: call forwarding
- custcat: customer category
- churn: churned (Yes/No)

## 1. Parametric Models
- Build ATF models with all the available distributions
- Compare the models
- Visualize all the curves: one plot for all
- Which model would you use as a decision maker (think about other factors apart from the above
comparisons)
- Keep significant features
- Keep the final model

## 2. CLV
- Calculate CLV per customer based on the final model; you can use the same logic provided in the slides.
- Explore CLV within different segments.

## 3. Report
#### Write a short report (1-2 paragraphs) about your findings. The goal is to understand the factors affecting
the churn risk.
-  Interpret coefficients
- Try to find the most valuable segments: describe the definition of being valuable according to you
- Assuming the data represents the population, how much would be your annual retention budget? (hint,
you should look at CLV, Survival probabilities and detect the number of at-risk subscribers within a
year)
- What else would you suggest doing for retention?
